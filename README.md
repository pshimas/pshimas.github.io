# NumberGenerator
 This is a static website that uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to run a random number generating game board that can be printed on a variety of paper sizes.

 ## Usage
 To install the application:
 * Follow the repo's instructions for clone the repository.
 * You can `git clone` the URL or you can "Download as a ZIP" to your computer.

 ## Application Architecture
 * All of the application features are in `index.js` at the root of this project. You will find inline comments that explain each line of code.
 * `index.html` has the entire structure of the DOM and it requires `index.js` for interactivity and `style.css` and `reset.css` for styling.
 * You will find a logo `RNG-logo-small.png` and `favico.ico` at the root of the project.

 ## Optional - Password Authentication
 There is code at the bottom of `index.js` that enables a password modal to block usage of the site. This feature is disabled by default. Please uncomment and follow the inline comments to be able to enable.

 ## Suggested Deployment Strategy
 As this is a simple website, I would recommend creating a *Netlify* account and using their [Drag and Drop Deployment Steps](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#drag-and-drop). As long as you have the project locally, you can drag and drop and see live in minutes.
